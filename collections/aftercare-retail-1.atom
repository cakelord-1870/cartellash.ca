<h3 align="left">Our EYENVY must be purchased in store only. This specific product is for end users, not for resale. We do not offer discounts or promotions of any sort for this particular product. The pricing has been set in accordance to EYENVY’s suggested MRSP. If you are a first time purchaser, we will include a brochure and explain application and use for the product. Please call, email or come in for price inquiries. </h3>
<ul class="list8">
<li class="wow fadeInUp">
<h3 align="left">
<br>Q: HOW DO I APPLY EYENVY<sup>®</sup>?</h3>
<p align="left">Firstly, ensure that the eye lid is clean. Shake the ingredients in the bottle; remove the excess of product from the tip of the wand by stroking it on the neck of the bottle 3 times. Apply EyEnvy<sup>®</sup> to the skin of the eyelid from the exterior to the interior area. Apply in the morning every day for 3 months and every other day for maintenance.</p>
</li>
<li class="wow fadeInUp">
<h3 align="left">Q: WHAT IF I HAVE SENSITIVE EYES?</h3>
<p align="left">We recognize that EyEnvy is not for everyone. If you are sensitive or allergic to any of our ingredients, EyEnvy<sup>®</sup> is probably not for you. We recommend usage every other day for sensitive eyes. Your results may take 2 extra weeks, but you will achieve results.</p>
</li>
<li class="wow fadeInUp">
<h3 align="left">Q: WHEN WILL I SEE RESULTS?</h3>
<p align="left">Everyone’s results may vary based on factors like age, sex, and application frequency. You may also achieve different results due to genetics, or if you are taking medication that affects your hormonal system. Typically most individuals <strong>start</strong> seeing results within 4-6 weeks. Full results are achieved within 3 months.</p>
</li>
<li class="wow fadeInUp">
<h3 align="left">Q: HOW DO I MAINTAIN MY LONG LASHES?</h3>
<p align="left">After daily use of EyEnvy<sup>®</sup> for 3 months we recommend applying our conditioner every other day. For sensitive eyes apply the conditioner every third day.</p>
</li>
<li class="wow fadeInUp">
<h3 align="left">Q: I WEAR LASH EXTENSIONS, CAN I USE THIS PRODUCT?</h3>
<p align="left">Yes. Because the product is applied to the skin and not the lashes it will not interfere with the bond of the glue. Make sure to wait 48 hours after your refill or full-set to allow the glue to adhere well. Many lash technicians recognize the benefits of using a lash conditioner with lash extensions for many reasons. The benefits of adding vitamins to the root of your lashes help to strengthen the bulb, disallowing the hair follicle from prematurely falling (due to the extra weight of an artificial lash). Due to the added length and volume of your lashes the technician can successfully increase more lash placement. Clients who want longer lashes but are limited due to their very short lashes can achieve longer length results because their lashes are long enough for the technician to apply even longer lashes which will adhere. Due to the increased density the technician may apply thicker lashes. We do recommend applying the product every other day while you are wearing individual lash extensions.</p>
</li>
<li class="wow fadeInUp">
<h3 align="left">Q: HOW LONG DOES A TUBE OF EYENVY<sup>®</sup> LAST?</h3>
<p align="left">A tube of 3.5ml of EyEnvy<sup>®</sup> will last up to five months and a tube of 2.0ml of EyEnvy<sup>TM</sup> will last up to 3 months if used daily as recommended. Once opened, the formula will remain active for 9 months. Unopened, a tube of EyEnvy<sup>®</sup> is good for 18 months.</p>
</li>
<li class="wow fadeInUp">
<h3 align="left">Q: I WEAR CONTACT LENSES? CAN I USE EYENVY<sup>®</sup>?</h3>
<p align="left">Yes. We recommend inserting contact lenses approximately 15 minutes <strong>after</strong> applying EyEnvy<sup>®</sup>.</p>
</li>
<li class="wow fadeInUp">
<h3 align="left">Q: WHERE CAN I PURCHASE EYENVY<sup>®</sup>?</h3>
<p align="left">EyEnvy<sup>®</sup> is Spa/Salon Exclusive. If you would like to purchase a tube kindly check our Locations to purchase section to find a location near you.</p>
</li>
<li class="wow fadeInUp">
<h3 align="left">Q: MY EYES ARE IRRITATED, ITCHY, OR RED FROM THE PRODUCT, WHAT SHOULD I DO?</h3>
<p align="left">The skin surrounding your eyes is highly sensitive. Certain individuals may be sensitive to one or more of the ingredients in EyEnvy<sup>®</sup>. Please take special care in following the application procedure. A high percentage of irritation for most clients is due to overuse or over application of our product. If mild or moderate redness or irritation occurs, discontinue use of the product at least temporarily until symptoms resolve.</p>
</li>
<li class="wow fadeInUp">
<h3 align="left">Q: I NOTICED SOME SKIN DISCOLORATION WHERE I APPLY EYENVY<sup>TM</sup>, SHOULD I BE CONCERNED?</h3>
<p align="left">Some customers have noted a slight darkening of the skin on the eyelid where they have applied EyEnvy<sup>®</sup>over a prolonged period of time. In most situations this will naturally fade with discontinued use of the product.</p>
</li>
<li class="wow fadeInUp">
<h3 align="left">Q: IS EYENVY<sup>®</sup> SAFE DURING PREGNANCY AND/OR BREASTFEEDING?</h3>
<p align="left">EyEnvy<sup>®</sup> has not been tested in all situations; therefore we do not recommend using EyEnvy<sup>®</sup>during pregnancy or breastfeeding.</p>
</li>
<li class="wow fadeInUp">
<h3 align="left">Q: CAN I USE EYENVY<sup>®</sup> ON MY EYEBROWS?</h3>
<p align="left">Yes. EyEnvy<sup>®</sup> can significantly improve the density of your eyebrows. Always keep in mind that if there has been any trauma to the eyebrow area which includes <strong>scar tissue, hair will not grow.</strong></p>
</li>
<li class="wow fadeInUp">
<h3 align="left">Q: WHY IS IT BETTER TO PUT ON EYENVY<sup>®</sup> IN THE MORNING?</h3>
<p align="left">The reason why EyEnvy<sup>®</sup> is best to be used in the morning is because studies have shown that when products near the eyes are applied at night, they have an increased chance of sensitivity to product due to various factors. When used in the morning the eye’s lacrimal glands are more active, sensitivity is reduced leading to a healthier experience with any product. Because we are unaware of the sensitivity levels of all clients we have created a general rule for everyone to use the product in the morning.</p>
</li>
<li class="wow fadeInUp">
<h3 align="left">Q: CAN I APPLY MAKEUP AFTER USING EYENVY<sup>®</sup>?</h3>
<p align="left">Yes, you can use all forms of make-up after applying EyEnvy. We suggest that you first apply EyEnvy<sup>®</sup> to a clean lid and then let it dry for 1-2 minutes. You may then apply make-up as usual.</p>
</li>
<li class="wow fadeInUp">
<h3 align="left">Q: CAN I PUT ON MASCARA AFTER APPLYING EYENVY<sup>®</sup>?</h3>
<p align="left">Yes. Mascara can be used 1-2 minutes after applying the serum. It is recommended to use the EyEnvy<sup>®</sup>&gt; mascara as it will also condition the lashes.</p>
</li>
<li class="wow fadeInUp">
<h3 align="left">Q: I HAVE/HAD CANCER/TREATMENTS, CAN I USE EYENVY<sup>®</sup>?</h3>
<p align="left">It is recommended to begin using EyEnvy 6 months after the last chemotherapy treatment. It will not have any interference, but rather because the effects of chemotherapy to kill cells in the body will not allow EyEnvy<sup>®</sup> to take its full effect. Thus, using EyEnvy<sup>®</sup> 6 months after treatment will ensure more accurate and stable results. Lastly, due to heightened sensitivity from chemotherapy, you should start use under the instructions for sensitive eyes, which would be to apply the product as instructed every other day.</p>
</li>
<li class="wow fadeInUp">
<h3 align="left">Q: WHAT ARE THE INGREDIENTS IN EYENVY<sup>®</sup>?</h3>
</li>
<li class="wow fadeInUp">
<p align="left">Water (Aqua), Myristoyl Pentapeptide 17, Butylene Glycol, Dextran, Acetyl Tetrapeptide 3, Trifolium Pratense (Clover) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Panthenol, Sodium Citrate, Leuconostroc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Polysorbate 20, Gluconolactone, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Benzoate, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Propylene Glycol, Yeast Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium PCA, Sodium Lactate, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Arginine, Aspartic Acid, PCA, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Glycine, Alanine, Serine, Valine, Isoleucine, Proline, Threonine, Tocopheryl Acetate, Histidine, Phenylalanine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Arctostaphylosa Uva-Ursi Leaf Extract, Magnisium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Benzoic Acid, Sodium, Metabisulfite, Triethanolamine.</p>

<p align="left">EyEnvy<sup>®</sup> has not been tested in all situations; therefore we do not recommend using EyEnvy<sup>®</sup>during pregnancy or breastfeeding.</p>
</li>
<li class="wow fadeInUp">
<h3 align="left">Q: CAN I USE EYENVY<sup>®</sup> ON MY EYEBROWS?</h3>
<p align="left">Yes. EyEnvy<sup>®</sup> can significantly improve the density of your eyebrows. Always keep in mind that if there has been any trauma to the eyebrow area which includes <strong>scar tissue, hair will not grow.</strong></p>
</li>
<li class="wow fadeInUp">
<h3 align="left">Q: WHY IS IT BETTER TO PUT ON EYENVY<sup>®</sup> IN THE MORNING?</h3>
<p align="left">The reason why EyEnvy<sup>®</sup> is best to be used in the morning is because studies have shown that when products near the eyes are applied at night, they have an increased chance of sensitivity to product due to various factors. When used in the morning the eye’s lacrimal glands are more active, sensitivity is reduced leading to a healthier experience with any product. Because we are unaware of the sensitivity levels of all clients we have created a general rule for everyone to use the product in the morning.</p>
</li>
<li class="wow fadeInUp">
<h3 align="left">Q: CAN I APPLY MAKEUP AFTER USING EYENVY<sup>®</sup>?</h3>
<p align="left">Yes, you can use all forms of make-up after applying EyEnvy. We suggest that you first apply EyEnvy<sup>®</sup> to a clean lid and then let it dry for 1-2 minutes. You may then apply make-up as usual.</p>
</li>
<li class="wow fadeInUp">
<h3 align="left">Q: CAN I PUT ON MASCARA AFTER APPLYING EYENVY<sup>®</sup>?</h3>
<p align="left">Yes. Mascara can be used 1-2 minutes after applying the serum. It is recommended to use the EyEnvy<sup>®</sup>&gt; mascara as it will also condition the lashes.</p>
</li>
<li class="wow fadeInUp">
<h3 align="left">Q: I HAVE/HAD CANCER/TREATMENTS, CAN I USE EYENVY<sup>®</sup>?</h3>
<p align="left">It is recommended to begin using EyEnvy 6 months after the last chemotherapy treatment. It will not have any interference, but rather because the effects of chemotherapy to kill cells in the body will not allow EyEnvy<sup>®</sup> to take its full effect. Thus, using EyEnvy<sup>®</sup> 6 months after treatment will ensure more accurate and stable results. Lastly, due to heightened sensitivity from chemotherapy, you should start use under the instructions for sensitive eyes, which would be to apply the product as instructed every other day.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><br>
Q: HOW DO I APPLY EYENVY<sup>®</sup>?
<p align="left">Firstly, ensure that the eye lid is clean. Shake the ingredients in the bottle; remove the excess of product from the tip of the wand by stroking it on the neck of the bottle 3 times. Apply EyEnvy<sup>®</sup> to the skin of the eyelid from the exterior to the interior area. Apply in the morning every day for 3 months and every other day for maintenance.</p>
<br>
Q: WHAT IF I HAVE SENSITIVE EYES?
<p align="left">We recognize that EyEnvy is not for everyone. If you are sensitive or allergic to any of our ingredients, EyEnvy<sup>®</sup> is probably not for you. We recommend usage every other day for sensitive eyes. Your results may take 2 extra weeks, but you will achieve results.</p>
<br>
Q: WHEN WILL I SEE RESULTS?
<p align="left">Everyone’s results may vary based on factors like age, sex, and application frequency. You may also achieve different results due to genetics, or if you are taking medication that affects your hormonal system. Typically most individuals <strong>start</strong> seeing results within 4-6 weeks. Full results are achieved within 3 months.</p>
<br>
Q: HOW DO I MAINTAIN MY LONG LASHES?
<p align="left">After daily use of EyEnvy<sup>®</sup> for 3 months we recommend applying our conditioner every other day. For sensitive eyes apply the conditioner every third day.</p>
<br>
Q: I WEAR LASH EXTENSIONS, CAN I USE THIS PRODUCT?
<p align="left">Yes. Because the product is applied to the skin and not the lashes it will not interfere with the bond of the glue. Make sure to wait 48 hours after your refill or full-set to allow the glue to adhere well. Many lash technicians recognize the benefits of using a lash conditioner with lash extensions for many reasons. The benefits of adding vitamins to the root of your lashes help to strengthen the bulb, disallowing the hair follicle from prematurely falling (due to the extra weight of an artificial lash). Due to the added length and volume of your lashes the technician can successfully increase more lash placement. Clients who want longer lashes but are limited due to their very short lashes can achieve longer length results because their lashes are long enough for the technician to apply even longer lashes which will adhere. Due to the increased density the technician may apply thicker lashes. We do recommend applying the product every other day while you are wearing individual lash extensions.</p>
<br>
Q: HOW LONG DOES A TUBE OF EYENVY<sup>®</sup> LAST?
<p align="left">A tube of 3.5ml of EyEnvy<sup>®</sup> will last up to five months and a tube of 2.0ml of EyEnvy<sup>TM</sup> will last up to 3 months if used daily as recommended. Once opened, the formula will remain active for 9 months. Unopened, a tube of EyEnvy<sup>®</sup> is good for 18 months.</p>
<br>
Q: I WEAR CONTACT LENSES? CAN I USE EYENVY<sup>®</sup>?
<p align="left">Yes. We recommend inserting contact lenses approximately 15 minutes <strong>after</strong> applying EyEnvy<sup>®</sup>.</p>
<br>
Q: WHERE CAN I PURCHASE EYENVY<sup>®</sup>?
<p align="left">EyEnvy<sup>®</sup> is Spa/Salon Exclusive. If you would like to purchase a tube kindly check our Locations to purchase section to find a location near you.</p>
<br>
Q: MY EYES ARE IRRITATED, ITCHY, OR RED FROM THE PRODUCT, WHAT SHOULD I DO?
<p align="left">The skin surrounding your eyes is highly sensitive. Certain individuals may be sensitive to one or more of the ingredients in EyEnvy<sup>®</sup>. Please take special care in following the application procedure. A high percentage of irritation for most clients is due to overuse or over application of our product. If mild or moderate redness or irritation occurs, discontinue use of the product at least temporarily until symptoms resolve.</p>
<br>
Q: I NOTICED SOME SKIN DISCOLORATION WHERE I APPLY EYENVY<sup>TM</sup>, SHOULD I BE CONCERNED?
<p align="left">Some customers have noted a slight darkening of the skin on the eyelid where they have applied EyEnvy<sup>®</sup>over a prolonged period of time. In most situations this will naturally fade with discontinued use of the product.</p>
<br>
Q: IS EYENVY<sup>®</sup> SAFE DURING PREGNANCY AND/OR BREASTFEEDING?
<p align="left">EyEnvy<sup>®</sup> has not been tested in all situations; therefore we do not recommend using EyEnvy<sup>®</sup>during pregnancy or breastfeeding.</p>
<br>
Q: CAN I USE EYENVY<sup>®</sup> ON MY EYEBROWS?
<p align="left">Yes. EyEnvy<sup>®</sup> can significantly improve the density of your eyebrows. Always keep in mind that if there has been any trauma to the eyebrow area which includes <strong>scar tissue, hair will not grow.</strong></p>

<p data-mce-fragment="1">Ruthie Belle Eyeliner was developed specifically to be compatible with eyelash extension wearers and does not affect adhesive bonds. It creates a defined and deep black line that stays on well, but does not contain nano carbon black, the smallest and most popular carbon black that is used in cosmetic products. The smaller the carbon black particles that are used to make eyeliners black, the quicker they enter the human body, which can lead to irritation. The lack of nano carbon black makes this eyeliner suitable for even very sensitive eyes.<br data-mce-fragment="1"> </p>

Amaterasu’s Liquid Eyeliner will not disappoint. The brush is meticulously hand assembled in Japan, using only the best quality microfibre that will not fray.

<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">Even newbies or those with super unsteady hands can easily create the most polished looks with this eyeliner. If you think only makeup artists can help you achieve perfectly lined eyes, think again! This eyeliner is a game changer.</span></p>

Brand Creator Sara Au Yeong tested the eyeliner in every possible condition where it might smudge: the shower, massages, workouts, and on her trips to Asia in over 40 degree Celsius weather. It stays on beautifully every time. Some of our clients even took it on camping trips where this product earned its nickname "The 24-hour Eyeliner."</span></p>
