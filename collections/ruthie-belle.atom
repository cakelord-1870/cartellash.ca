<div class="description-tag-content" data-mce-fragment="1">
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Ruthie Belle Eyeliner was developed specifically to be compatible with eyelash extension wearers and does not affect adhesive bonds. It creates a defined and deep black line that stays on well, but does not contain nano carbon black, the smallest and most popular carbon black that is used in cosmetic products. The smaller the carbon black particles that are used to make eyeliners black, the quicker they enter the human body, which can lead to irritation. The lack of nano carbon black makes this eyeliner suitable for even very sensitive eyes.<br data-mce-fragment="1"> </p>

This product superdries any lash adhesive (no matter the humidity/original curing time) to cure instantly (0.5-1 sec depending on the amount of adhesive used).</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>HOW TO USE?</strong><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">You can either use it as a primer on the natural lashes or cover 1-2 mm at the bottom of the eyelash extensions (while the lashes are still on the strip) with Adhesive Superdry and continue working as usual. Repeat if you feel that the adhesive does not cure instantly.</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">Summer:</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">Summers are usually hot &amp; humid so all adhesives cure faster than in the winter. Sometimes adhesive still remains sticky after you’ve placed the lash though. This is where Superdry comes in handy - use it on the natural lashes exactly like shown in the video. It will gently strip excess sebum (oil) from natural lashes without drying them out like traditional primers/pre-treatment serums do. By gently opening lash cuticles Superdry boosts adhesive curing just enough to prevent it from staying sticky. Yet, adhesive will not cure any faster before it is already placed on the natural lash.</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">Winter: </span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">Winters are usually colder and drier so adhesives cure slower. Use Superdry to make any lash adhesive (no matter the original curing time) cure in less than 1 sec. Use Superdry while lashes are still on the glue strip and if necessary on the natural lashes like shown in the video.</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">Use a clean micro brush to apply the product on your client’s lashes. Do not double dip the used micro brush in the product jar to avoid any cross-contamination.

This makes the lash extension stronger. With Superbonder, lash retention grows by up to 30%. The tighter bond also blocks glue fumes and adds elasticity to the adhesive bonding points. The added elasticity makes the lashes more flexible, less sensitive to touch and less prone to breaking or falling off.</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">The reduced fumes make Superbonder a safer product to use for professionals and their clients. Everyone is more protected from the lash glue fumes, a cyanoacrylate based glue, and clients have reported less irritated eyes.</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">Instead of the usual 24 hour drying time, within 3 minutes of being applied, lash extensions are done. They can even get wet!</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">With Superbonder there is no need for the typical curing with water droplets. This step is skipped entirely because Superbonder mixes with cyanoacrylate and does the curing process from within. When a Nanomister or Nebulizer is used, the curing process is done from the outside and humidity stays in the adhesive. This means the surface of the adhesive remains porous, so the bond is weaker and more fumes are released. With Superbonder there is no need for a Nanomister or Nebulizer, but you can still use one if you or your client wishes. Just wait for the 3 minutes so that Superbonder dries.</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>HOW TO USE IT</strong><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">- Wait 2 minutes after you have attached the last extension of the set</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">- Apply 2 drops onto a microfibre brush (no need to soak)</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">- Wipe adhesive bonding points</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">- Allow to dry for 3 minutes</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>OTHER INFORMATION</strong><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">One 15ml bottle services 150-200 treatments/clients.

    <td colspan="2"><meta charset="utf-8"><span data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>Dark Matter</strong> is a fast-setting and oil-resistant lash glue that results in better retention.</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">- Works with virtually any humidity and temperature</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">- Bonds in half a second to one second</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">- Minimal fumes</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">- 100% oil proof</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">- One glue dot lasts for up to 5 hours</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">- Stays fresh for 3 months after opening</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">- Allows you to work faster</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">- Suitable for intermediate and advanced lash stylists</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">- Works with all types of lashes and techniques</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">- Contains castor oil</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">- Does NOT contain carbon black</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>HOW IT WORKS?</strong><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">The purity of the cyanoacrylate used in Dark Matter allows it to work with any humidity and any temperature. Generally, the higher the humidity the longer the glue drop will stay fresh, but tests show Dark Matter works perfectly in humidities varying from 10% to 95%, and the glue is optimized in temperatures that range from 16°C to 39°C (61°F to 102°F).</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">While Dark Matter sets very fast, it does not dry out on your lash plate or lose its adhesive capability. One glue dot can be worked with for 1.5–5 hours. This means one bottle of Dark Matter will last from 3 to 10 times more than other adhesives and you will work much more efficiently as you do not need to refresh your glue dot every 30 minutes.</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">Dark Matter is sensitive to alcohol, so AVOID all high alcohol content products as they affect retention in a negative way (includes hand sanitizers and regular primers/glue accelerators).</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>HOW TO USE IT?</strong><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">- Shake well for 1 minute before first use</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">- Apply a drop of Dark Matter on silicone or foil (DO NOT use on plastic, paper, tape or jade stone as these react to the adhesive)</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">- Allow to air for 5 minutes</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">- Work from the middle of your glue drop, using a scooping technique to pick up a bubble of adhesive and apply it on the root of the extensions</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">- No need to replace glue dots even when they begin to dry out from the outer edge. Get a fresh dot only when the texture becomes stringy</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">- If you use pinching method/finger roll to create volume fans, do not use hand sanitizers with high alcohol content (opt for alcohol-free hand sanitizer) and do not use regular primers/glue accelerators as their main active ingredient is alcohol. Use ONLY Ruthie Belle’s Adhesive Superdry as a primer/adhesive accelerator (Superdry works with all other adhesives too).</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">For more information, watch Ruthie Belle’s “How to use Dark Matter” video </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgiIuPADAY" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgiIuPADAY">here</a><span data-mce-fragment="1">.</span>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">NB! Dark Matter is not compatible with Prolong lash cleanser.</p>
<strong>HOW TO STORE IT?</strong><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">- Shake well for 10 seconds once a day after opened</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">- Keep container tightly closed when not in use</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">- Store away from direct sunlight or heat</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">- Keep in a cool place, preferably under 25°C (77°F). Unopened bottles may be kept on the middle shelf of the refrigerator. In these cases, take out 30 minutes before first use and shake well for 2 minutes. Never keep an opened bottle of Dark Matter in the fridge to avoid condensed water from developing and starting the glue’s curing process within the bottle.</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">- If stored correctly, Dark Matter stays fresh for 6 months unopened and for up to 3 months after opening</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>OTHER INFORMATION</strong><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">Dark Matter is produced only twice a month so that customers always receive fresh glue. You can check the manufacturing date (d/m/y) within the “Ch:…” code found on the bottom of the bottle.</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">Dark Matter is black, but does not contain carbon black. It is produced in the EU with the same high “medical grade” cyanoacrylate used in wound adhesives. Please note that Dark Matter should be used only by experienced lash artists.</span><br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">INCI: 2-Methoxyethyl 2-Cyanoacrylate, Dimethyl Silicone Polymer with Silica, Acrylates, Ricinus Communis Seed Oil, CI 77499</span></td>
