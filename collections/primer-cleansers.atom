<p><span>Refreshing eyelash extension cleanser keeps your lashes fluffy and clean at all times. Great way to clean your lashes after make-up and before professional lash application.

<p>1.7 fl.oz/50ml</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p><strong>How To Use:</strong></p>
<p>For in home use or on the go, spritz solution on your Unicorn Duo Brush or your Teal Bristle Wand and start at the base of the lashes and comb upwards to the tips of your lashes. No need to rinse or pat dry.Â </p>
<p>For professional use, spritz solution on your Unicorn Cleansing Brush orÂ with a micro-swab starting at the base of the lashes to the tips of the lashes. Pat dry with a lint free cloth.</p>
<p><strong>How isÂ Fluff Guard different from Lash Shampoo ?</strong></p>
<p>Fluff guard is a specially formulated solution to clean lashes from oil, protein, or eyeshadow residue. It is not a make up remover. We recommend this solution to clean lashes of residue OR, if yours fans are not fluffy anymore due to cosmetics, use Fluff Guard around your eye area. This solution does NOT need to be rinsed or dried.<br><br>We recommend you use it before lash application to clean your lashes from proteins &amp; oils the could prohibit your extensions from staying. It can remove small amounts of makeup ... but for complete makeup; we recommend<span>Â Bubble Lash Shampoo.</span><br><br>Bubble Lash Shampoo is a complete lash AND eye make up remover. Itâ€™s a cleanser for skin around the eyes. It is in foam formula and needs to be rinsed and pat dry.<br><br>When these products are used in tandem, your retention will be all it can be!</p></td>
